roademd_approx is a very general approximation scheme for computing Earth mover's distance,
  applied to road networks with road-wise constant density

roademd_approx2 is a road network-specialized approximation scheme which is much more efficient, but is still inexact

roademd provides the *exact* algorithm, which is *also* more efficient than either approximation scheme

just testing...
